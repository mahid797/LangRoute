# Security Policy

## Purpose
This document explains how to report vulnerabilities in LangRoute and what to expect.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately.

- **GitHub Security Advisories:** Use the repository's Security tab and click **Report a vulnerability**: https://github.com/bluewave-labs/LangRoute/security/advisories/new
- TODO: Add a project security email for reports once available.

Please do not open public issues for security problems.

## What to Include
When reporting, please include:

- Affected version or commit
- Environment and system details
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Potential impact
- Suggested severity (CVSS vector if known)

## Response Expectations
- We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days** (TODO: confirm window).
- We will send status updates at least **weekly** until the issue is resolved (TODO: confirm cadence).
- Target timelines for fixes:
  - Critical: 7–14 days (TODO: confirm)
  - High: 14–30 days (TODO: confirm)
  - Medium/Low: scheduled as appropriate, typically <90 days (TODO: confirm)

## Disclosure Policy
We follow coordinated disclosure. We prefer to work with researchers on a mutually agreed timeline that balances user safety with transparency. Reporters will be credited after a fix is released if desired; anonymity will be respected.

## Safe Harbor
We support good-faith security research that:

- Makes a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Does not exfiltrate data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Does not use social engineering, physical attacks, or denial of service (volumetric or resource exhaustion)
- Complies with applicable laws

If you are unsure whether an action is acceptable, contact us first.

## Scope
In scope: vulnerabilities in this repository and official LangRoute deployments.

Out of scope:

- Denial of service without novel attack techniques
- Automated scans or brute force attacks without proof of exploit
- Issues in third-party dependencies without an exploitable path through LangRoute
- Best-practice recommendations without direct security impact

## Supported Versions
| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| TODO    | TODO (maintainers to define supported versions) |

## Contact / Encryption
If you need to encrypt your report, TODO: provide a project email and PGP key when available.

Thank you for helping keep LangRoute and its users safe.
